Palindrome Algorithm
This is a simple algorithm to test if a given word is a palindrome or not. A word is considered to be a palindrome if it can be read the same way from left to right as it can be from right to left.

How to use
To use this algorithm, follow these steps:

Run the main program by running the palindrom function.
Enter a word that you want to test.
The function will return true if the word is a palindrome, and false if it is not.
How it works
The algorithm works by comparing the first and last letters of the word. If they are the same, it moves on to the second and second-to-last letters, and so on. If any of the letters don't match, it immediately returns false. If it reaches the middle of the word and all of the letters match, it returns true.

The algorithm is implemented recursively, with each call to the pal function comparing the first and last letters of the word and then calling itself with the next pair of letters. The recursion stops when there are no more pairs of letters to compare.
